# Emotion Recognition Model

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform emotion recognition on images. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `tensorflow`
- `opencv-python`
- `matplotlib`
- `IPython`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib IPython
